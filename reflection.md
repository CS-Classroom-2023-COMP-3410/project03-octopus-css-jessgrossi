When adding to styling to this webpage the area that I found most complicated was color matching the colors of the webpage to those in the screen, but I went with html colors that are close enough. I did try to use chat GPT to find the colors using the given screenshot as a way to solve this problem to get the exact hex codes of those used, but it did not help as it not get the colors. 

Another challenge that I faced was the styling of the quiz section. It was hard to make the box have two columns without any seperation. I did try to right and left align these items put it not completely match. Additionally, the boxes and submit button were difficult to style. I did try to give Chat GPT a screen shot of the quiz area to show how I wanted the area styled. This did not change any of the style elements. I did not know how else to change the styling of this area to completely match.
